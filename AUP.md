#Github Acceptable use policy

The Soham Village College Computing department are currently piloting the use of a website with our Computer Science students. The site (www.github.com) is a widely used platform for programmers and software develops who are collaborating on projects. By using this platform students will be able to:
- Easily access course materials directly on their Raspberry Pi
- Submit their work for assessment and feedback
-	Save their work incrementally
-	Receive feedback from their teacher, other pupils, or the wider community.
-	Collaborate on and share their own independent projects
-	Contribute to the wider software development community.


**However**, the Github platform is purposefully open and therefore much of the pupil’s activity can be viewed by other public users. Also all pupil accounts would be associated with the College’s account, it is therefore important that pupils and teachers follow some simple rules when using the Github platform:
####All Users
Both pupils and teachers will use the Github platform in a sensible and professional manner. This includes:
-	Using a school monitored email account for school work based on Github.com.
-	Choosing an appropriate username and avatar for their profile.
-	All communication between users should be polite and purposeful.

####Pupils
-	If pupils decide to contribute to other projects on Github using their school account they are representing the school and must behave accordingly.

####Staff
-	When providing feedback to pupils teachers will give qualitative feedback, suggesting improvements and setting targets. However grades will not be shared on Github.com.

##Agreement
Parent
As part of our involvement with other schools and groups, raising the profile of Computer Science and best teaching practices we may occasionally wish share examples of students using the Github platform with other professionals.
•	I am happy for my son/daughter to use the Github platform for their Computer Science work next year.
Pupil
We expect all pupils taking Computer Science next year to read, understand and follow the rules for acceptable use of the Github.com service.
•	I have read and agree to the acceptable use policy for using Github.com for Computer Science work.
